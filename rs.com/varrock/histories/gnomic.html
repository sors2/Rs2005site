                                                This humorous text dates from a mere few years ago, when gnomes and the people of Misthalin were 
                                                first beginning to interact. Before the days of the gnome pilots and the gnome ambassadors that 
                                                have spread gnomish culture across the lands of RuneScape, 
                                                we had little to do with this enigmatic race, whose humour was so foreign to us.</i>

                                                            before the Grand Tree came into being, the gnomes were planning to

                                                            just too tall. It's a waste of perfectly good skin."

                                                         <p>Gnomes have always been sensitive about their height - or lack of it -
                                                            and some say that their famous sense of humour is a defense mechanism 
                                                            born out of insecurity.

                                                            you know."

                                                            pieces of gnome everywhere. I recoiled in horror, wondering how such a 
                                                            terrible thing could have happened. Only then did I discover that this 
                                                            was not the real Dr. Darius, but a synthetic model. The good doctor now 
                                                            appeared from behind a potted plant, convulsing with laughter.
                                                         </p>

                                                            that us big 'uns can have fun, too. I would forge a new era of man-gnome
                                                            relations by being an ambassador of silliness.

                                                         <p>Which is exactly what I did. Arming myself with the most custardy

                                                            bottom was a rather funny-looking gnome, who was obviously just minding 
                                                            his own business.

                                                            remained eerily silent. I thought I'd better explain myself.
