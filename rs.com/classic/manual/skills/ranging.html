                              <p>The ranged skill is used for attacking players or monsters from a distance with either
                                 bows and arrows or crossbows and crossbow bolts. This skill is useful if you want to
                                 help a friend fight. More than 1 person can attack an monster or player by using the
                                 ranged skill.<br><br>

                                          <p>To use a bow you need to wield it. You must also have some appropriate
                                             arrows or bolts in your inventory. </p>
                                          <p>Click to attack a monster or player and you will shoot your arrows/bolts
                                             until you do something else or are attacked. You cannot shoot a player or
                                             monster if you do not have a direct line of sight. (For example, if there
                                             is wall or tree between you and the monster.) </p>
                                          <p>Monsters attacked by ranged will run directly to attack you in hand to hand
                                             combat where you will not be able to use your bow. If you shoot at a
                                             monster from the other side of a fence or piece of furniture then the
                                             monster will not be able to get to you and you can keep on shooting it.
                                          <p>A number of your arrows will land on the ground by your target so you can
                                             go and use them again, however some will be lost as they are damaged upon
                                             impact.
                                          <p>For further information on the selection of bows available to make and also
