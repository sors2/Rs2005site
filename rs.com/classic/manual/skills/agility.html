                                          Agility is a skill that can be used to get over, up and through various
                                          obstacles, often as a short cut, or to get into new areas.
                                          <p> Typical examples of where you use your agility skill are to squeeze
                                             through a pipe, swing on a rope over a hole, or use some handholds to climb
                                             up a wall. </p>
                                          <p> Just click on the obstacle you wish to get past, and if you have the
                                             appropriate agility skill level you will attempt it. </p>

                                          You will never fail some obstacles once you reach the appropriate agility
                                          level. On other obstacles it is possible to fall off, which will cause you to

                                          level. On other obstacles it is possible to fall off, which will cause you to

                                          <p>A good way to advance your agility skill is to use the obstacle courses. By
                                             going round the obstacle course in the correct order you can get an agility
                                             experience bonus from the course. This is in addition to the normal agility
                                             skill experience you get from attempting single obstacles.</p>
                                          <p>Players with low-levels of ability might want to use the obstacle course in
                                             the tree gnome stronghold. At level 35 you can also enter the obstacle
                                             course at the barbarian outpost. </p>

                                          Agility is a fatigue skill, which means that as you use it your character will
                                          slowly tire and eventually need to find a bed to rest on. Eating food will
                                          also reduce your character's fatigue slightly. For more information on fatigue
                                          please see our fatigue guide.
