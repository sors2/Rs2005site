Reldo Writes:<br>
The origin of 
this text is unclear. It speaks of a tunnel system known to exist west 
of Ardougne, though here in Misthalin we hear precious little of what 
lies inside. If even a fraction of this tale is true, I shudder to think
 what else might stalk the hidden corners of RuneScape.</i>

<u></u></p><h3><u>Spirit of the Pass</u></h3>

<p align="justify">
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p><img style="float: left" src="../../../../img/varrock/elaborate/elaboratey.gif">ou must be 
careful walking through the Underground Pass: it is filled with the 
spirit of Zamorak. You can feel it as you wind your way round the 
stalagmites - like an icy chill that threatens to penetrate the fabric 
of your being. Not so many travellers come down here these days, but 
there are some who are still foolhardy enough.</p>
<p>I remember seeing one such warrior going by the name of Randas, he 
stood tall and proud like an elven king, but that same pride made him 
vulnerable to Zamorak's calls. Randas's worthy desire to be a great and 
mighty warrior also made him corruptible to Zamorak's promises of glory.
 Zamorak showed him a way to achieve his goals, by appealing to that 
most base and dark nature that resides in all of us.</p>
<p>It starts as a whisper in your ears. Dismissing the sounds as the 
whistling of the wind, Randas steeled himself against these forces and 
continued on his way. But the whispers became moans, at once fearsome 
and enticing, like the call of some beautiful siren. "Join us!" The 
voices cried, "Join us!" </p>
<p>"Why fight against your nature?" They asked Randas. "Your greatness 
lies within you, but only Zamorak can truly unlock your potential."</p>
<p>In time these voices became visions. Visions of human armies, wasted 
by some unseen hand. Their bodies lay heaped together like some 
amorphous mass of mutilated flesh. And standing on top of this great 
heap stood Randas, a bloody sword in one hand, and a glazed look in his 
eyes. A destroyer of his own people... but a victor all the same.</p>
<p>Upon entering Zamorak's Tower it is said that Randas performed a 
ritual that would alter his spirit forever. Kneeling down at the sacred 
altar, he spilled his blood into a silver chalice and offered it to 
Zamorak. Randas began to chant the words of ancients: strange, twisted 
noises from deep in the bowels of eternity.</p>
<p>This was the spirit of Zamorak, pulsing through his body like the cry
 of an animal from some unholy sacrifice. His whole form began to 
convulse as charges streamed through his muscles. But the power was too 
much for his mind; it was as if the forces of darkness were a black 
cloud expanding inside his head. As he witnessed yet more ghoulish and 
nightmarish visions, the world outside seemed to disintegrate in front 
of him.</p>
<p>The world was still there - it was Randas's mind that had been 
broken. And now if you get lost in the tunnels you might just stumble 
into Randas. A shadow of a man, his eyes are hollow, with no life behind
 them. For Randas is part of the asylum now, just one of the many 
walking dead. A human vegetable, he wanders the tunnels in a zombie 
state, oblivious to all his surroundings. Ask him about Zamorak and he 
will tell you as much as he can remember. He may even tell you more 
about the ritual that he performed.</p>
<p>Just don't let curiosity get the better of you... </p>
