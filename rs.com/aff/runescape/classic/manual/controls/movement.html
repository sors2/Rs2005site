                                    In order to do anything in the game, you will first need to learn how to get around the world. Fortunately movement is quite simple, and is just a case of pointing the mouse-cursor at the point on the ground where you would like to go, and clicking with the left mouse button.

                              A small yellow cross will briefly appear to indicate that the request was received, then a few moments later your character will start to move. If the yellow cross appears, but your character doesn't start walking immediately, then just wait a few seconds, as it may take a few moments before anything happens. Your character will walk until his/her feet are at the point where you clicked on the ground, and will automatically work out how to walk around any trees or obstacles which may be in the way.

                              To interact with an item in the world first point your mouse at it.  Look at the top left of the screen and you will see a list of things  you can do with that item. For instance if you point at an object  you will see that you can 'Take' the object. To choose the first  option listed, click it with the LEFT mouse button.  To choose from one of the other available options click with the RIGHT  mouse button, and choose the option you want from the menu which appears.  When you request the action a red cross will briefly appear to indicate  it was received. You may have to wait a few seconds for your character  to perform the requested action.

                                    For instance, in the example on the right, the player is pointing  at one of the characters in the game, and in this case is given the  default choice of "Talk-to Lowe". By LEFT clicking on the character  the player could start a conversation and perhaps buy some arrows.  By RIGHT clicking, the player could instead access a menu with other  available actions.
