                                                   all in black, with pale skin, and of dark countenance. And although 
                                                   Arrav knew himself to be in the Land of Dreams, where things cannot be 
                                                   trusted to be what they appear, this man was different from the other 
                                                   travellers he had encountered, and spoke to him by name:
                                                </p>
                                                <p>"I know you, Arrav of Avarrocka, Curse of Goblins, Hunter of the

                                                   am Zemouregal of the Mahjarrat tribe, and this land is mine for the

                                                   ends with your utter defeat at my hand. You will serve me eternally as a

                                                </p>
                                                <p>And when Arrav awoke, he was much afraid, for he knew not how he 
                                                   could face an enemy that could challenge him in the Land of Dreams, and 
                                                   make him remember the events of dreams, that normally passed with the 
                                                   hours of awakening, so Arrav went to consult the elders.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>The elders of the tribe could not explain to Arrav how such a man 
                                                   could appear to him in the Land of Dreams, and were sorely troubled.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>For seven days and nights the elders discussed Arrav's encounter in 
                                                   the Land of Dreams, and all agreed that it was a bad omen and that Arrav
                                                   could not remain in Avarrocka for fear of woe befalling the town that 
                                                   it had now become. So they decided that Arrav must be sent on a quest 
                                                   that he could never complete so as to spare their town the wrath of the 
                                                   ominous and terrible man. Yet Arrav's strength and wisdom meant that any
                                                   normal quest could not be given, as he could easily defeat any enemy 
                                                   and fetch any item.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Then on the seventh night, the eldest of the elders spoke up. He had a
                                                   dimly remembered memory from his youth of tales of a fabulous shield 
                                                   that did not belong to this world, and that was strong against nearly 
                                                   every attack, but whose whereabouts were unknown. When the other elders 
                                                   heard of this tale they were puzzled, for none of them had ever heard 
                                                   such a tale, and they wondered how the old man could remember such a 
                                                   distant memory so clearly. In truth, the elder himself could not explain
                                                   how this memory had come to him so clearly while he had slept, yet all 
                                                   agreed that this was the perfect quest to remove Arrav from Avarrocka 
                                                   and protect it from the portent they feared.

                                                   pass that the elders of Avarrocka told Arrav of this shield, and that 
                                                   it would be necessary for the protection of the town, and Arrav agreed, 
                                                   and began to make ready his equipment for the quest. Along with the 
                                                   sword he had been given when training as a child, he brought enough 
                                                   bread and cooked meat to last him seven days in the lands outside of 
                                                   Avarrocka, where men feared to venture, and set out of the confines of 
                                                   the town and into the lands beyond.

                                                <p>Arrav had not travelled far west when he came upon a strange house, 
                                                   surrounded by mist. Wondering what kind of being would abide in such a 
                                                   place, yet unafraid, he entered the house to meet three men inside 
                                                   sitting arguing at a table. The argument was a passionate one, and they 
                                                   took no notice of Arrav as he entered their house. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>The language they spoke was strange and unfamiliar, yet somehow he 
                                                   could understand what they were arguing about, and it seemed to be about
                                                   the ownership of the house they were standing in. The argument did not 
                                                   make much sense to him, but the first man was apparently complaining how
                                                   the others had crept in while he was asleep, and that they had stolen 
                                                   the house he had made for himself.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Arrav wondered what the man meant by the others, but noticed a number
                                                   of smaller figures, almost too small to notice, huddled around the 
                                                   shadows of the table chittering to each other almost below his hearing. 
                                                   The noises and speech of the place concerned Arrav, and he decided to 
                                                   continue on his way leaving this strange house behind him, for the 
                                                   things he had seen did trouble him greatly. Arrav headed west again, 
                                                   with the sounds of argument continuing behind him until he could hear 
                                                   them no longer.

                                                   could see and close to a towering and icebound mountain. At the foot of

                                                   looked like men, yet were far shorter, and they seemed unafraid of Arrav
                                                   as he approached them.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>He spoke to them of the shield he sought, and although they denied 
                                                   any knowledge of such an item, he could see in their eyes a guardedness 
                                                   that made him doubt the truth of their claims. Arrav stood tall and 
                                                   asked them who they were, and they spoke to him, "We are of the clan 
                                                   Imcando, known far and wide for our skills with weaponry," and seemed 
                                                   puzzled that he had no recognition of them. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Sure that the dwarves knew more of the shield he sought than they 
                                                   admitted, Arrav decided to stay with them and gain their trust, and 
                                                   perhaps learn more of the whereabouts of the shield he had pledged to 
                                                   find.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Many moons passed as Arrav stayed amongst the dwarves, and eventually the leader of the Imcando summoned Arrav to him.</p>
                                                <p>"Your ways are strange to us, Arrav of Avarrocka, yet we see the 
                                                   honour with which you carry yourself. When first you came amongst us you
                                                   spoke of a mighty shield. We know you suspect us of having knowledge of
                                                   such an item, and that is why you have remained here. We have offered 
                                                   you our hospitality, and as we have come to know you we have seen you to
                                                   be a man of honour, so speak now why you search for this item, for it 
                                                   is one of our greatest treasures and we cannot allow it to fall into the
                                                   hands of the undeserving."
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Arrav spoke of his encounter with the darkly dressed man in the Land 
                                                   of Dreams, and at the mention of the name Zemouregal he saw a dark 
                                                   shadow fall across the countenance of the elder.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>"We know of this being who calls himself Zemouregal. For many years 
                                                   he has attempted to gain control of this shield, for it is a mighty 
                                                   artefact that will bring him great power against all races should he 
                                                   gain possession of it. Long ago we vowed that this must never happen, 
                                                   for we dwarves have memories of the time when gods walked this land, and
                                                   do not wish to see such devastation return. Although we know you to be a
                                                   man of great honour and courage, you cannot defeat Zemouregal, and we 
                                                   must never allow him the chance to gain control of such a powerful 
                                                   object. I fear that he has manipulated you and those you obey, and must 
                                                   ask you to leave as your continued presence here serves only to alert 
                                                   him to our settlement."
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Arrav's heart was filled with sadness at these words, for he had 
                                                   become accustomed to spending time with the Imcando and learning their 
                                                   ways of mining and smithing, yet he knew the wisdom of these words. As 
                                                   the dwarf spoke them to him, he realised why the elders of Avarrocka had
                                                   sent him on this quest, for their fears were the same as the Imcando's:
                                                   that Arrav could bring nothing but woe and lamentations to them while 
                                                   staying in such a place. With a weariness in his heart, Arrav continued 
                                                   on his quest, for he knew that he must find the shield his elders sought
                                                   whether he had the assistance of the Imcando or not.
                                                </p>
