                                                first beginning to interact. Before the days of the gnome pilots and the gnome ambassadors that 
                                                have spread gnomish culture across the lands of RuneScape, 
                                                we had little to do with this enigmatic race, whose humour was so foreign to us.</i>

                                                            and some say that their famous sense of humour is a defense mechanism 
                                                            born out of insecurity.

                                                            pieces of gnome everywhere. I recoiled in horror, wondering how such a 
                                                            terrible thing could have happened. Only then did I discover that this 
                                                            was not the real Dr. Darius, but a synthetic model. The good doctor now 
                                                            appeared from behind a potted plant, convulsing with laughter.

                                                            relations by being an ambassador of silliness.

                                                            remained eerily silent. I thought I'd better explain myself.
