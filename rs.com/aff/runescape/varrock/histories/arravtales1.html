                                                The Legend of 
                                                Arrav is almost a founding document for the city of Varrock. In ancient 
                                                times, when first men came to this land, they founded the village of 
                                                Avarrocka, where Varrock now stands, and Arrav was their first and 
                                                greatest hero.</i>
                                             </p>
                                             <p><i>This lengthy tale explains how Arrav came to be, how he 
                                                carried himself as a man, and how his doom came upon him. In times of 
                                                darkness and fear the people of Varrock still turn to this story as a 
                                                beacon of hope - for, if in those days before the power of runes, man 
                                                could protect himself from the horrors of the Necromancer, surely we can
                                                still protect ourselves now.</i>

                                                            child was brought into the camp and raised as their own child, and they

                                                            skills of hunting. He taught them the skill of silence, and of the

                                                            eating, and where to stand in wind and streams so that animals could not
                                                            detect the hunter's presence, and of tracking the prey in the forests

                                                            best, and of the changes in the clouds that showed how crops would grow,
                                                            and of growing certain crops together to prevent the sprouting crops

                                                            saw how fortunate they were that such a mighty warrior should have been 
                                                            delivered unto them.

                                                            child to be around twelve years old, yet the child was still unnamed. So
                                                            the elders decided to send the child on a quest to find a name, for 
                                                            they would not be able to call the young man 'Child' for much longer. 
                                                            And they said to him, "Go forth and bring back a name that your people

                                                            first time since he had been found.

                                                            and stars to find his name. After a number of days, he did come upon an
                                                            encampment of goblins who had discovered the village of Avarrocka, and 
                                                            did plan to make it their own with a nightfall attack. And as the 
                                                            goblins saw him, they screamed at him in their own language "arrav" as 
                                                            they attacked him. And they screamed "arrav" louder as he bested them, 
                                                            by individuals and by groups, until they all lay dead or defeated.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>So the child returned to Avarrocka, and the elders asked him if he 
                                                            had found his name yet. And the child recounted the tale of the goblin 
                                                            camp, and how their murderous plans had been thwarted by his luck in 
                                                            finding them, and his skill in fighting them. And one of the wisemen 
                                                            said to him:
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>"Your name, Child, is now Arrav, for that is the name the fates have 
                                                            given you. It is a curse word in the goblin tongue. The fates have 
                                                            decided your true name to be a curse upon goblins, for that is what you 
                                                            truly are." All agreed that it was a good name, and much rejoicing was 
                                                            had for the village had been spared the sword and the flame.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>And as Arrav grew, so did the village of Avarrocka, for it was 
                                                            situated on fertile land, and it became prosperous. As the tales of 
                                                            Arrav's defeat of the goblins spread among both humans and goblins the 
                                                            village grew larger, as humans came to live there in peace, and Goblins 
                                                            stayed away, for they were fearful of Arrav, the Curse of Goblins.
