                           harassing yourself or other players, or is generally being disruptive, there are various
                           things you may do.

                           This will enable us with your help to take quick and effective action against the abusive
                           players in Runescape.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Please Note: (reference trade scams)</b></p>
                        <p>We must remind you though that if you do lend anyone anything it is at your OWN RISK! Many
                           people are conned by others and whilst we are trying to catch them, the problem will be
                           minimized if you only engage in swaps and trusts if you are FULLY 100 percent convinced that
                           they are trustworthy.</p>
                        <p>Please also note that we cannot replace any money or items that have been lost.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><b>Punishments</b></p>
                        <p>
                           Our punishments range from a verbal warning, to black marks being accrued against your
                           account. This will lead very quickly to temporary and permanent bans should you re-offend.
                           The severity of punishment will depend on the severity of each report and the number of total
                           reports against a player.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Caution - How to use the Report Abuse System</b></p>
                        <p>
                           If you are going to send in a report against a player you must make sure that it is a
                           legitimate claim of abuse. This means that it must contain evidence of the above situations
                           or we will not be able to take any action.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Before sending in a verbal abuse report please try and think about whether you are genuinely
                           offended by the other players remarks. If the chat filter has blocked out the profanity then
                           there is <b>no</b> need to send in a report. Please only do so if you are genuinely offended.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Sending in hoax reports slows us down with dealing with your other queries, and repeatedly
                           doing so is likely to result in action being taken against your account.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           For example petty abuse such as simply calling someone a "noob" is not a good enough reason
                           to report someone for abuse. Being offensive to someone else and then reporting them when
                           they retaliate is also a complete misuse of the system. Our logs clearly show the incident
                           that is reported, so it will be easy see who actually started the abuse.
                        </p>
                        <p>So please, take some time and use some common sense to ensure that your report is valid.</p>

                           There are certain circumstances when it is better to report players through our online report

                        <p>
                           If you come across a player in game that is harassing you and you wish to ignore the player,
                           you can do so by reading the following:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           If there is a particular user causing a problem then use the ignore function to block further
                           messages. (To do this click the red 'unhappy face' icon between the yellow 'happy face' icon
                           and the log out button, click where it says 'add name' and finally enter the name of the user
                           to block.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           If you continue to receive unwanted messages, or receive harassment from multiple players
                           then you should use the privacy controls to block all messages from everyone except your
                           friends. (To do this click the buttons marked 'Public Chat', 'Private Chat' and 'Trade /
                           Duel' at the bottom of the screen until they say either 'friends' so only people on your
                           friends list can speak to you, or 'off' to prevent all messages).
                        </p>
